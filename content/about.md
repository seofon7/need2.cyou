Hi there, friends!

I'm Emmie (she/her) and I'm an engineering dropout with an overactive internal monologue.

I made this site so that I would have a place to throw all my rants and ramblings. The above-mentioned internal monologue needs an outlet!

"The domain name," I hear you asking, "what's it mean?" Good question, my dear reader! I don't really know! The `.cyou` bit was cheap and interesting, and the `need2` bit was my desperate attempt to have something short and meaningful to tack onto the rest of it. I mean, I could read into it a bit as some sort of cheesy romance thing, or even deeper as an inherent need for human connection, but it's mostly just a fun way of turning the domain into a phrase as a whole.

"But Emmie!" I hear you asking again, annoyingly, "Where's the little picture in my browser tab that makes me happy?" Slightly-annoying-but-still-dear reader, that little guy is a favicon, and I have entirely neglected to make one. I might have one eventually, but don't hold your breath.

If you wanna get in touch with me, shoot me an email at [em@need2.cyou](mailto:em@need2.cyou)!

Thanks for checking out my site!

-Emmie <3

Hi there, friends!

I'm Em, and I'm an enby uni student with an overactive internal monologue.

I made this site so that I would have a place to throw all my rants and ramblings. The above-mentioned internal monologue needs an outlet!

This site is sorta still in its feel-it-out stage, so some things might yet change. This About page, for starters. "There's nothing interesting here at all," I hear you muttering to yourself. I agree. This is honestly just placeholder text. :p

Anyway, I want to make a little contact form to put on this page, but that's a future problem.

For now, if you wanna get in touch with me, shoot me an email at [em@need2.cyou](mailto:em@need2.cyou)!

Thanks for checking out my site!

-Em <3

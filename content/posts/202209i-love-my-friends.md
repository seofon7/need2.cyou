Happy first post!

I was actually planning to post something a little under a month ago, but then the very things I was going to write about kept me too busy to write about them :p

So here's this instead, now that I'm feeling properly inspired.

> **Note**: I will be using some terms in the following post that some people may not be familiar with, so I've included a [glossary](#glossary) for your reference.

## That pandemic thing, remember that thing?

Since this is my first post,[^first] it's probably good to fully explain the parts of me that are important to this post. As you may have heard, there was that big pandemic not too long ago[^pandemic] and I, like many people, found myself spending a lot less time around others, and a lot more by myself. While I'm sure that this has had some lasting damaging effects on my ability to socialize with people, it also forced me to confront those nasty things inside my head, for real this time. 

I had never really considered who I was as a person up until that point. People called me "smart",[^comma] whatever that even means,[^smart] but that's hardly a description of anyone's---let alone my---true self. The second time that my little part of the world went into a proper lockdown (spring of 2021) I was first introduced to the internet's latest obsession: femboys! Those cute little pictures of cute little femboys awakened something in me! I had always thought I was only attracted to women, but at that point, I decided to really delve into the realm of _very sexy men_ and see if maybe I felt something from that. I spent a few days doing some, _\*ahem\*_, research, and came to the conclusion that maybe men weren't as gross as I had always felt they were.

"Hey wait, Em, did you just say that you thought men were gross?" I hear you saying.

Yes. I did. I swear this is relevant to the story.

During the _research_, I began to develop the idea that men as partners weren't actually that repulsive. However, the thought of _Man X Man: Time For The Gay_ was still pretty off-putting for me. "Interesting," I think to myself. Why is gayness so gross when I literally just decided that I am also attracted to men? At some point I made the connection between this and my longtime habit of engaging in imagined sexual fantasies as a woman. "Hey wait, gay sex with a man is gross, but straight sex with a man isn't?" It was around this time that I also made the extraordinarily bold decision that I was bi, and that I had figured out my sexuality, and that while I was at it... gender should be next. How hard could that be? I'd have myself all figured out by next week!

## Gender? More like, "gENDER OF SANITY"

The next few days were pretty tough. It was really really hard to even consider the possibility that I might not be cis. I'm not really even sure why I pushed through it, to be honest. I think it might have been my obsession with completion and optimization nagging me about having questioned sexuality and not gender... I suppose I just couldn't live with the fact that if my assumptions about my sexuality had been wrong, I might also have some issues with my gender assumptions. It took a large amount of effort to even get myself to ask the question of "are you a man?" Luckily, I asked it, but now I was stuck with the task of answering it.

For many people, I'm sure it's as easy as, "Well, I'm a man. Always have been, always will be." I really envy those people for their ability to just... know who they are. I was coming to realize that I _didn't_ have an easy answer like that, despite thinking that I did. Now that I was giving myself the option to _pick my gender_ for the first time ever, I was realizing how much I disliked my current cis assumptions.

There was so much pain in my life at this time. This process was incredibly emotional for me, perhaps because of the huge taboo related to gender nonconformity that had been impressed upon me from an early age. I was learning so much about gender and people's diverse experiences with it, and I was slowly putting together a picture of what my own gender might actually look like.

## Well whaddya gonna do about it??

After a few weeks I had worked up the courage to talk to my mom about how I didn't think I was cis. Unfortunately, she tried to convince me that I was actually cis, and that I just hadn't found the way that I would live my perfect cis life. Needless to say, I was quite upset by this, and it pushed me away from talking to her---or the rest of my family---about my gender. This was in mid-to-late spring, 2021.

I spent the rest of spring and all of that summer just stewing in gender thoughts. I finished high school in June, and during my graduation---which was a terrible drive-in theatre shenanigan with no real fun to be had---all I could think about was the strict gendering of all the snazzy suits and dreamy dresses being worn. I wanted so desperately to be free to choose what to wear, but that would have caused an unwanted controversy among my family members, and I was nowhere near ready to even begin to deal with that sort of situation. I played along and got my photo taken with the principal, and that was that. Happy graduation.

It was my last summer in my hometown before moving away to the city to pursue university, and I had a full time job and many high school friends to see before we drifted apart. I made time for hangouts and get-togethers on weekends and evenings, and I think that I did a pretty good job fitting people in. It would have been a good summer if not for the ever-present gender haze above my head.

## snapback for a rate/tbh

It was around the beginning of summer, 2021 that a couple of friends that I had grown distant from in the past few years just... texted me out of the blue. I was randomly[^random] added to a snapchat group called "snapback for a rate/tbh" and given very little useful contextual information, so naturally, I respond in some sort of mildly-flirty-but-in-a-friendly-joking-manner mixed with a bit of \[my excuse for\] sarcastic wit. It must have worked, because we quickly got ourselves got up, and the three of us added a fourth member to the group. Really what happened was the three of them added me to their group, but either way, the four of us became much closer over the summer.

That summer I had a couple sleepovers with those friends. I was the only male-presenting one in the group, and I remember being concerned about my family's (and their families') assumptions during those sleepovers. A boy at the girls' sleepover isn't traditionally acceptable. This was compounded with the fact that I knew I wasn't the boy at a girls' sleepover, leading to a lot more discomfort about the whole thing than I think I let on. I'm pretty sure I just came across as awkward and quiet. I still really enjoyed myself though.

## Off to school

By the end of August, I had packed up and moved to the city to live in the basement with my aunt and uncle. I stayed in touch with my snapback friends while continuing to suffer through my gender crisis. School came fast and hard, and I found most of what little free time I had consumed with gender thoughts. This little self exploration exercise had become so important to me, and it was becoming increasingly important to me that I figure it out for good.

At some point I had become aware of the term "non-binary" in regards to one's gender. I'm not sure exactly when, but the term was one that I kept coming back to. I knew that I wasn't a man; that part was easy. However, I wasn't so sure about being a woman. It was certainly more attractive than being a man, but it still felt a little off. Non-binary seemed to be the solution, since the term includes all gender identities outside of man and woman, and that label didn't need me to fully make up my mind. There was a lot of variation within it, and it felt large enough that I would have some wiggle room for deciding on stuff.

Eventually I decided that non-binary was the right term for me. As for pronouns, I applied the same logic: he/him are a no; she/her feel weird; they/them fits the best and doesn't require me to make up my mind just yet. I had finally come up with my gender and pronouns, and it was me this time rather than the doctor. By this time it was late fall, 2021.

## The (digital) letter to end all letters

Having decided on my gender, (for now) I wanted to tell some people about it. You know, come out to them. The people in question were, of course, the snapback gang. Though I felt that they were pretty likely to accept my coming out, it was still this mountainous thing that I found extraordinarily difficult to even begin thinking about. I figured that writing a letter would be the best way to do it, since I could take my time to get the wording right, then send it all at once and take time to prepare for the responses.

I got to working on the letter, and it was so very difficult to write. It was the first time that I had really solidified my feelings about gender. Until that point, my thoughts were somewhat formless and didn't have any bearing outside of my own mind. This was the first time that I was putting those thoughts out into the outside world, and it was the first time that I had to actually confront many of them. The single hardest sentence I had ever typed was contained in that letter.

I am transgender.

Writing it again now, it was pretty easy for me. I've since come to terms with myself and confronted much of my internalized transphobia, but at the time of the letter, it was nearly impossible to type. I think I spent a good half hour (at least) on that single sentence, writing the letter late at night in my dark basement room on November 25, 2021. I knew what I wanted it to say, but I couldn't find the strength to actually type it out. I'm happy that I did though, because it was an important emotional moment for me to finally accept myself.

I put a lot of effort into that letter, and it served as a manifesto for my identity at the time. I made sure to include as much information as was reasonable so that I wouldn't end up confusing people or leaving them with too many questions. I tried to keep it somewhat impersonal, as I couldn't quite bear the thought of a critical response to a deeply personal letter, unless it felt impersonal.

Writing that letter was the single most important event in my gender journey.

## The responses to end all responses

I sent the letter shortly after midnight on November 26, 2021. I made sure to send it in several formats so that a small technical difficulty wouldn't make it unreadable. I wanted to be able to send it, and then run away (metaphorically) to give myself time to prepare for the responses. I also wanted to wait and read all the responses at once.

After sending the letter to each of the snapback gang individually, I turned everything off and went to sleep. I don't remember if I slept well or not, but it was a school night, so I tried to get my rest. I'd need it when reading the responses as well.

I attended that day's classes, trying to focus on the lessons and not the responses to my letter. I knew that reading the responses would be very emotional for me, so I wanted to go somewhere private. Unfortunately, I didn't feel like my bedroom was safe enough, so I went for a walk instead. My university has some nearby walking trails, and not many people were using them at the time.

So I went for a walk on the trails, coming nearly all the way back to campus before I finally worked up the courage to look at my phone. I stopped on the trail and sort of stood around for a while, maybe twenty or thirty minutes. Eventually I pulled out my phone, then just stared at it, because opening the responses would mean no going back. My relationships with snapback members would forever be changed, and that change terrified me.

Finally, I convinced myself to open those responses.

And they were outstandingly positive, every single one of them.

I felt so so validated and accepted in a way that I hadn't before. I bared myself to these people that I loved, and they saw me and loved me back.

I don't think I can adequately express in words exactly how much that meant to me. It was the emotional experience of a lifetime, and I was so filled with relief and joy in that moment.

This was the culmination of months of struggling and thinking and reflecting, and it was so so good.

## My apartment, present day

The intensity of that moment stayed with me, as did the immense love for my friends. I am so much _more_ with them in my life. I truly am forever grateful for their continued love and support.

I'm not sure how, but yesterday I spontaneously remembered that day, and the emotions were still so strong. I sent a long appreciation message to the snapback group letting them know how much they mean to me, and then I decided to reread that letter. Even though it was so impersonal in many parts, I could feel my emotions coming from underneath. That one declaration really did it to me.

I am transgender.

Looking back, it honestly changed my life. That one statement is the most powerful I've ever made, and I'm incredibly grateful for having received such an overwhelmingly positive reaction to it.

In fact, I've decided that November 26 will be my transiversary, in honour of those emotions and the love of my friends.

See you all next time!

Em <3

## Glossary

- **assigned gender at birth** (AGAB): the gender that one's doctor/nurse told their parents that they were, usually represented on your birth certificate as M (male) or F (female) (rarely X; lookup the term intersex for more info) and generally defines the way that one is raised and lives one's life, at least in my experience of Western society
- **cisgender** (cis): adjective to describe the experience of associating oneself with one's assigned gender at birth. One is cisgender if one is happy with the M or F on their birth certificate.
- **transgender** (trans): adjective to describe the experience of _not_ associating oneself with one's assigned gender at birth. One is transgender if one is unhappy with the M or F on their birth certificate.
- **assigned male/female at birth** (AMAB, AFAB): term to denote one's assumed gender based on their external primary sex characteristics. (generally penis vs vulva)
- **nonbinary/non-binary** (NB, enby): adjective to describe the experience of existing outside the Western gender binary. (man/woman) Different from intersex. (research sex vs gender for info) Enby may be used as a noun. (similar to man or woman; pronounced "enn-bee" or "NB"; plural is "enbies")

[^smart]: Off topic: I didn't really feel... worthy of their praise. I felt like a fraud somehow, like I was deceiving people for attention that I didn't even want. To me it really felt like people were celebrating this ability of mine to learn and understand things that I hadn't really put much effort into developing. I always thought that they would be better looking at things that I consciously worked on, like my being a (hopefully) kind and respectful human being. As I'm writing this, I'm realizing that maybe I did have a part in my "smartness" being what it was, (and still is) since I have this fascination with interesting things in the world around me. I love learning about random stuff, and I often find some fun stuff to feed my insatiable curiosity with. This is a nice feeling, knowing that maybe it was me who was responsible for it. It feels like the praise might have been justified now.

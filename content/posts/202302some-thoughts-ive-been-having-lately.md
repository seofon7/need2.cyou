Greetings, small furry creatures. Your queen returns, the Faux Fur Fanatic that I most certainly am. Those who fear me call me Triple F.

First, some updates! I've actually been using she/her pronouns for a month or two at this point, and the weirdness of them (as described in my previous post, [I Love My Friends](/2022/09/i-love-my-friends/)) has diminished considerably. I think that it was mostly just a matter of getting used to them, and I experienced a similar thing when I introduced my new preferred name to my life. There's just a slightly uncomfortable period of mild awkwardness when the new name/pronouns/whatever still haven't been broken in yet.

Also! I dropped out of engineering as of the start of the winter semester at the start of this year. I'm pretty happy about that decision, and I really appreciate all the free time that I magically have now. I haven't really begun to look for work or other programs yet, cause I wanted to just take some time to relax, but I think it's just about time to start really considering that now. I've had enough time to unwind a little bit, and I'm starting to get restless.

That restlessness is actually the main topic of this post. I've been really thinking about all the fun hobbies and creative endeavours that I'd like to partake in, but I haven't actually started any of them. I've barely even been able to do any pleasure reading. For some reason, I just can't get started on doing these things that I *know* will bring me joy and fulfillment. I suspect that this is related to some sort of perfectionism or related anxieties.

Some of the things that I want to be doing with all my free time these days include: writing, making music, reading, drawing, assorted crafty things, and probably lots of other activities that escape my tiny little rodent-like brain at this time. Actually, writing this post is the most creative I've been for a long time, and it took quite a while to hype myself up enough to actually sit down and begin to write it. I knew that when I started, it would be pretty easy to continue, but it's always starting that's the hardest. Ugh.

I've also *just* broken up with my partner of almost two months over the weekend, which was probably the smoothest breakup experienced by anyone ever. We basically just realized that we weren't really having the best time as partners, and figured we should just revert to friends. I even gave them a little box of cookies for Palentine's Day, (today) and they gave me a little arrangement of artificial flowers, which was very lovely.

While the breakup was really smooth, the days leading up to it were kinda rough. I was spending a lot of time reflecting on what my life has been like for the past two months, and how I wanted to approach living in the near future. One of my largest issues with myself over the last, say, quite a while, is the fact that I can't seem to convince myself to spend time doing things that I know I'll enjoy. Writing this post is an example of something that I knew I would enjoy, but somehow couldn't get myself to actually do for a pretty solid amount of time. I know that doing it is actually pretty painless once I get going, and that it might kinda suck, but the best way to get better *is to suck* for a while --- these ideas don't seem to actually help me in my ability to get started on the project, though.

I also really want to start playing my musical instrument(s) again, but that's another thing that, while it's hard to start initially, gets way less painful after picking the darn thing up. It's also another thing where my perfectionist fear of failure anxieties really start to kick in. *Obviously*, I won't be a masterful bassist immediately after plugging in the amp, but somehow, I can't stand the thought of me plugging it in and just sounding *bad*.

I seem to be itching for something to do, or to make, and I know that I have enough skills and whatever to be able to make something pretty fulfilling *right now* if I tried, but it just... isn't something that I can do. It's incredibly frustrating, and I might have to seek professional help for this if I can't manage to start doing fun stuff sooner than later. I know that I'll probably end up being a not-too-bad creative once I get into the swing of things, which almost makes the prospect of sucking for a while that much less appetizing.

Anyway, I'm pretty happy with myself that I managed to get this little post written and up. It might not be particularly special, but it's a good first step in an area of my life that hasn't seen any steps at all for quite a while. I'm happy that I let myself spew some thoughts onto my computer screen for a while. I think I've released some of that built up tension in doing this. Maybe I'll write some garbage fanfic later today, hehehe

Ok that's all for now! Have a *wonderful* Thursday morning! *Especially* if it's not actually a Thursday morning! It isn't Thursday while I'm writing this, but you can bet your mother's good earrings that I'm having the Thursday morning of my *life* right now.
